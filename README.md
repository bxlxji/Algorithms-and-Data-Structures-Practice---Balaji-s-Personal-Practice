# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Practice---Balaji-s-Personal-Practice

Hey! I'm Balaji (pronounced BAA LAA JEE). This repo is a record of some of my practice programs. 
This is written only as documentation for myself and not as a tutorial. This repo respresents my 
ability to learn and Problem-solve creatively. I have used "Python 3" as the coding language since it allows me to focus on learning the topic without detering my ability to express fluently. I have used "Miniconda" for its light footprint and ease of access to even heavier programs if needed. Miniconda Installs Python 3 and a lot of other packages such as Jupyter Notebook,etc. I have added a file path to the python.exe present inside miniconda folder for all my programs to use. I have primarily used "Visual Studio Code"(VS Code) as my Integrated Development Environment(IDE) for some programs. I have also used "PyCharm" and "JupyterLab" to efficiently make use of a Python centered IDE and Jupyter Notebooks without the hassle of using a browser and accidentally losing all my code. The Links to all the Programs will be mentioned at the bottom for your reference.

I began my Documentation Practice with "Data Structutures" and then moved on to "Algorithms".
